When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When you have multiple people working on a project or you want to share your work with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because you might not be ready to share your code or make a commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A fork is a copy of a repo from Github to Github.  A clone is a copy of a repo from Github to your desktop or desktop to desktop.  a branch can be on Github or desktop and is a branch off of a master.
