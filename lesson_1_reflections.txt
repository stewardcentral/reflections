How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It lists only the difference between the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Compare old and new files; revert back to previous version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro - less updates to sort thru; Con - could forget to commit/save update

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git was designed for coding and it is often necessary to track multiple files for each commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can use git log to find when changes were made and what changes; then use git diff to see exactly what lines of code were changed/added/deleted

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always determine which version operated as planned and revert back to that code or identify the error by using "git diff"

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
